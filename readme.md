# witch-clock-bot

This is a twitter bot that tweets the date according to [witch-clock]() any time it changes. witch-clock expresses dates relative to the nearest solar and lunar events, like so:

* VE-75 means the vernal equinox occurs in 75 days.
* WS+14 means the winter solstice happened 14 days ago.
* FIRST-2 means the first half moon occurs in two days.
* NEW+6 means the new moon happened 6 days ago.

Altogether, witch-clock-bot tweets dates like, "VE-75, WS+14, FIRST-2, NEW+6".

witch-clock uses [astronomia]() to estimate when a solar or lunar event occurs. Because the precise moment depends on the actual positions of various cosmic bodies rather than algorithms computing their expected locations, the estimation may be off by about a minute. In another fifty years, it'll be off by more.
